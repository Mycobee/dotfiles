## About

This is a very rough repo attempting to keep track of the configs I generally use on work laptops, usually MacOS. By and large I like to keep things simple. The Rails dev in me prefers less configuration and more convention. But the SysAdmin in me feels compelled to configure things from time to time.

Feel free to take any of this and use it however you want.

### Disclaimer

Dotfiles are a very personal thing, and these are by no means comprehensive, up-to-date, or better than other options out there.

**Please don't blame me if you try something here and it breaks your existing configs.**

*this^^ should be obvious...not my chair, not my problem*

## TODO:

Get this set up for Linux. Implement YADM. Add universal setup
