## About

This is a very rough repo attempting to keep track of the configs I generally use on work laptops, usually MacOS

Feel free to take any of this and use it however you want

### Disclaimer

Dotfiles are a very personal thing, and these are by no means comprehensive. Please don't blame me if you try something here and it breaks your existing configs.


### TODO:

Get this set up for Linux. Implement YADM. Add universal setup
